# Introduction
We understand that reliability growth testing is important to track throughout a programs lifetime the reliability of the program so that you can determine when it meets the customers needs. It helps developers identify the root causes of failure in a system and by identifying these failures it can help them increase reliability. As Software Engineers we have to be thinking about the costs of unreliable software and we need to strive towards building software people can trust. 

We also understand that a reliability demonstration chart is a useful tool to figure out when your product is in an acceptable range for both the customers wanted risk and the devolopers wanted risk.
