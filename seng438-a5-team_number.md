# Introduction
We understand that reliability growth testing is important to track throughout a programs lifetime the reliability of the program so that you can determine when it meets the customers needs. It helps developers identify the root causes of failure in a system and by identifying these failures it can help them increase reliability. As Software Engineers we have to be thinking about the costs of unreliable software and we need to strive towards building software people can trust. 

We also understand that a reliability demonstration chart is a useful tool to figure out when your product is in an acceptable range for both the customers wanted risk and the devolopers wanted risk.

# Assessment Using Reliability Growth Testing 
We were able to get Failure Data Set 2 working for the STRTAT program, unfortunately we found that most of the test datasets with the .DAT file type were unable to run so we did not use any of those. But by plugging in the data from the word document given in Falure Data Set 2 we were able to run the geometric and Little Wood and Varal's Bayesian Reliability models. You can see from the photos provided of running our tests we found that slowly the reliability of Failure Data Set two is growing, from these graphs it shows that over time the MTTF is increasing which shows signs that the reliability of the system is growing, it is not conclusive whether the system is actually reliable yet as we do not know the specifications of the system but we can conclude from both of these models that the MTTF is getting larger and thus our failure rate is decreasing so our reliability must be increasing.
